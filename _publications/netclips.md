title: "NetClips: A Framework for Video Analytics in Sports Broadcast"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2018-NetClips
excerpt: 'This work presents an early stage big data application, NetClips, for automation in broadcast production in the area of content management, delivery, and consumption. NetClips acts as a cognitive engine to automatically annotate video clips with contextual sports content during match production and on archival contents. Ensemble of deep learning architectures and advanced machine vision techniques are used in NetClips to accurately recognize players, objects, actions, and game events in every clip created during a sport broadcast. This application also has a great impact on production workflow, as it will lift up the burden of concurrent tagging from operators list of duties.'
